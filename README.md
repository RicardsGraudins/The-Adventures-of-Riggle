# The Adventures of Riggle
This repository contains code and information for my first-year undergraudate project completed in 2015 for the module **Mobile Application Developement 1.** The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Damien Costello.

#### Overview:
For this project I created an endless runner game inspired by Mario using the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/). The goal of the game is to collect coins and avoid spikes while staying on top of the platforms in order to set a high score. The player can collect various objects in order to double the score gain from coins for a limited time and in order to add some difficultly to the game the player's speed will increase the longer the game goes on.

#### How to run:
Simply download the folder and run test.exe located inside AppStandAlone on a Windows device, no prerequisites are required. If you wish to view the game using Unity, open the folder Endless Runner using Unity and accept to convert it from an older version of Unity.

Note: The game is nowhere near finished however it does possess the fundamental features of an endless runner game such as player & camera movement, randomly generated platforms, coins, obstacles, powerups, object pools etc.
