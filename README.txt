AppStandAlone:
This was built by selecting the Windows, Mac OS X and Linux standalone option in unity and the targeted platform was Windows
and the only build version that manages to run on my computer. If you click test.exe it should load up everything in
test_Data and launch the program. 

Endless Runner:
The Endless Runner file is the exact copy of the file I used in unity and all of it can be loaded in unity and it will show everything I did to make the app
that is if you want to look at that & all the C# coding can be viewed in Endless Runner -> Assets -> Scripts..

EndlessRunnerUniversal:
EndlessRunnerUniversal was built by selecting windows store and universal 10 in unity which has the VS solution file if thats what you're looking for
and this is the part that goes wrong for me and I tried all the different versions but none of that works on my machine like I mentioned in the email.
